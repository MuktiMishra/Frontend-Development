Web Development Basics – Answers

1. Difference between Frontend, Backend, and Full-Stack Development

- Frontend Development:
  It deals with the visual part of a website that users interact with directly.
  Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  Example: Designing the homepage of an e-commerce website with a navigation bar, product images, and buttons.

- Backend Development:
  It handles the server-side logic, databases, and APIs that power the frontend.
  Technologies: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Java (Spring Boot)
  Example: Processing payments or retrieving user data from the database when a user logs in.

- Full-Stack Development:
  It involves both frontend and backend development.
  Example: A full-stack developer builds both the user interface and the server logic for an online booking system.

             |  Request (HTTP)
             v
        [Web Server]

             |  Data Request
             v
         [Database]
             |
             |  Response (Data)
             v
        [Web Server]
             |
             |  Response (HTML/CSS/JS)
             v
     [Client/Browser]


3. How a Browser Requests and Displays a Web Page

1. The user enters a website URL (e.g., www.example.com).
2. The browser sends an HTTP request to the web server hosting that site.
3. The DNS (Domain Name System) converts the domain name into an IP address.
4. The web server locates the requested file (like index.html) and sends it back.
5. The browser renders the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the webpage to the user.


4. Tools Required for a Web Development Environment

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| Text Editor (VS Code, Sublime Text) | Writing and editing HTML, CSS, and JS code. |
| Web Browser (Chrome, Firefox) | Testing and debugging web pages. |
| Version Control (Git) | Managing code changes and collaboration. |
| Package Manager (npm, yarn) | Installing libraries and dependencies. |
| Local Server (XAMPP, Node.js) | Running backend code locally before deployment. |


5. What is a Web Server?

A web server is software that stores, processes, and delivers web pages to clients using the HTTP protocol.
When a browser requests a page, the web server sends the required files.

Examples of common web servers:
- Apache HTTP Server
- Nginx
- Microsoft IIS
- LiteSpeed
- Node.js (Express)


6. Roles in a Web Project

- Frontend Developer: Builds the user interface (UI) and ensures responsiveness and interactivity.
  Example: Designing login and signup pages.

- Backend Developer: Manages the application logic, APIs, and database interactions.
  Example: Handling user authentication or form submissions.

- Database Administrator (DBA): Maintains and optimizes databases.
  Example: Managing data backup and performance tuning.


7. VS Code Installation and Configuration (Description)

- Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com
- Install extensions:
  - Live Server (for live preview of HTML files)
  - Prettier (for code formatting)
  - HTML CSS Support and JavaScript (ES6)
- Open a new folder and create .html, .css, .js files.
- Use Go Live to view your webpage in the browser.

8. Static vs Dynamic Websites

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Static Website | Displays fixed content. Each page is a separate HTML file. | Personal portfolio site built using only HTML and CSS. |
| Dynamic Website | Displays content that changes based on user input or database data. | Social media platforms like Facebook or Twitter. |


9. Five Web Browsers and Rendering Engines

| Browser | Rendering Engine |
|----------|------------------|
| Google Chrome | Blink |
| Mozilla Firefox | Gecko |
| Microsoft Edge | Blink (previously EdgeHTML) |
| Safari (Apple) | WebKit |
| Opera | Blink |

Explanation:
Rendering engines are responsible for converting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into visible web pages.
Each engine interprets code differently, which may cause slight design or performance variations across browsers.
